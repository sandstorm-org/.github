We are building Sandstorm as a community open source project, and are beginning to migrate resources from sandstorm.io to sandstorm.org. You can read more about this process at [here](https://sandstorm.org/news/2023-10-23-sandstorm-tempest-and-the-future) and [here](https://sandstorm.org/news/2023-11-03-from-io-to-org).

We are looking for new contributors for Sandstorm, Tempest, and related apps and tools, as well as donations at https://opencollective.com/sandstormcommunity
